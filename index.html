        <h1>Lakes</h1>

        <p>
          Spanning nearly 32,000 square miles, Lake Superior is not only the
          largest freshwater lake in the world (by surface area) but it is also
          one of the largest lakes in the world, second only to the Caspian Sea.
          In fact, if you were to add up all the water in Lake Michigan, Lake
          Huron, Lake Ontario, and four of Lake Erie it would total the volume
          of Lake Superior.
        </p>
        <h1>Wildlife</h1>

        <p>
          With more than half the state covered in forests, Michigan is filled
          with white pine (the state tree), American mountain ash, boxelder,
          sugar maple, and red mulberry. Michigan rose, orange coneflower,
          evening primrose (check it out blooming at night!), and yellow monkey
          flower are some of the wildflowers that grow in the Wolverine State.

      <p>
        “There are cities that get by on their good looks, offer climate and
        scenery, views of mountains or oceans, rockbound or with palm trees; and
        there are cities like Detroit that have to work for a living, whose
        reason for being might be geographical but whose growth is based on
        industry, jobs. Detroit has its natural attractions: lakes all over the
        place, an abundance of trees and four distinct seasons for those who
        like variety in their weather, everything but hurricanes and
        earth-quakes. But it's never been the kind of city people visit and fall
        in love with because of its charm or think, gee, wouldn't this be a nice
        place to live.”
